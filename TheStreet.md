"I love you" -- it's all I remember her saying before she walked out into the street and got herself killed by a log truck. I'll never forget the sound of the thwack as her body crumpled into the fender or the look on the trucker's face as he kept apologizing for something he could not do.

She died on a Saturday in April on Chesterfield Street between the burned-down church and the water tower. A part of me died, innocence and hope, that day, too. She'd been taking her medicine, eating better, gave up smoking, and even started to laugh again. I think I'd become comfortable with the idea that she'd be here -- it had been over three years since her last attempt -- but I was wrong.

"Rose? Rose Porter? Are you all right? Can I get you anything?" the minister asked.

I opened my eyes, mascara probably dripping down my face, but I didn't care. "No, I'm fine," I said with a sniff. "It looks...clean." Clean? Who says that about a building? I couldn't think of anything else to say.

"Thanks. We finished it last month. It sure beats the Horace Whitaker Elementary cafeteria. I don't want to boast, but I think just about everyone in the town gave into the building fund. I mean, even The Millers over on Turnipseed, and you know they don't have much of anything." The minister's unkempt facial hair glistened gray in the sunlight as he spoke. The last time I saw him, it was coal-black and neat.

I scoffed. "Maybe they'd be better off feeding their kids. How many do they have now, twelve?"

"Won't you come inside? It's pretty hot out here." He held his robed arm out toward the church.

"I'll be fine, thanks. I've got to go in a minute or two. Do you mind if I--", I stopped myself to pantomime taking pictures.

"Oh, not at all," he said with a bow like some sort of monk. "Stay as long as you like, but if you want to take a breather in the A/C, just come on in. We're always open."

I watched him leave, then pulled out my phone to take a picture of the church to send to my older brother James. "They rebuilt it," I texted him.

"I liked the way it looked before," James responded.

"With or without char?"

"With!"

"Haha! I totally agree! Are we going to hell?"

"I'm going there for more reasons than you are, I'm pretty sure," he said.

"Awe! Tell Mike I love him. Gotta few more stops, then I'm headed back to State."

"Sometimes I think he loves you more than me. Don't you go stealing him, okay?"

"As long as you're good to him, I won't have to," I said with a laughing emoji.

"Ha! You be careful, k?"

"K," I said, then put the phone back in my back pocket. When I turned to leave, the minister pretended not to be watching me and let himself back into the quarter-cracked door. My face flashed with anger.
