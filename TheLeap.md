"I don't know why I threw it out, Bill!" She clutched her lone crutch and hobbled over toward the table where Bill hugged a mug full of black coffee now cold from the argument.

"You threw out the new one, too! I have half a mind to go down to that radio station and demand, on air mind you, that Doug buy you another one."

Rhonda plopped herself down into the chair beside Bill and started to cry.

"Don't do that," she said into a tissue. "It's not his fault. I'm the one who threw it."

"Dammit! I hate it when these preachers do that shit to gullible people!" Bill slammed his mug on the table launching a coffee missile toward the ceiling. "I mean, don't take that as an insult. I'm not mad at you, but someone's going to get hurt and slimy preachers profit from promises they can never make God keep. Who do we hold accountable?"

Rhonda dabbed at the pool of coffee on the table with the dry end of her tissue. "You know I will never understand your way of life, and I don't expect you to understand mine. It's hard being the only person in this house who believes. Do you know how lonely it'll be in heaven without you and the kids?" She waited for a response.

Bill took a slow sip of his coffee, staring at the foot of the table where the dog chewed off the varnish. "One day here shortly I'm going to refinish that there leg. Damn mutt," he said into his mug.

"Why is it that every time I bring up my faith, you bring up something stupid like the table? That happened in 1978, Bill. You're never going to fix that darn spot." When Rhonda said "darn", she blinked hard and blushed.

"It's something I know for certain that needs doing. You can't go around fixing everything in the universe whispering on a rug in the bedroom. I seem to recall you saying that God could do it. I've been waiting for it to happen for over forty years. By now, I reckon if it's gonna get fixed, it's gonna be by my hand. Watch, pray for it."

"The Lord doesn't want us to test..."

Bill interrupted. "Oh doesn't he? Why'd you throw out that crutch? Hmm?"

"That's different," Rhonda straightened in her chair. "I don't expect you'd understand. Pastor Douglas..."

"For God sake, call him Doug. He's never going to be 'Pastor Douglas' to me. I grew up with the man. Shit, we got drunk in a parking lot after our homecoming game in tenth grade."

"*Pastor* Douglas is a man of God who is trying to bring back the power and authority of the church. If we don't take leaps of faith, we won't create a space for God to inhabit."

Bill shook his head. "That's horse shit and you know it. Are you walking yet? Did the bones in your ankle realign? Tendons all good?" He caressed the ankle in his lap he'd been massaging. "Didn't think so. If God's gonna heal you, he doesn't need you to do anything crazy--he'll just do it. That crutch was expensive."

Rhonda took her foot back from Bill and pushed herself up to stand. "I'll go back and get it."

Motioning for her to sit, Bill billowed, "Like hell you will! The last thing we need is a seventy-year-old woman on one foot hobbling around in the dark on the side of the road. I'll have more problems on my hands than a damn crutch. I'll get it in the morning on my way down to the shop. Hopefully it'll still be in one piece."

Rhonda looked up at him. He'd gained a pickup truck's tire around the waist and lost all but a few strands of hair on his head, but he was every bit as stubborn as the day they married.

"You love me," she said as she patted his hand.

"You know I do. You're my girl, Kid. I don't know why you love a damn fool like me, but you do." He said, then helped her up from the chair. "What do you say we head to bed?"

"Well," Rhonda said, "you know I'm not tired yet."

"And neither am I," he said with a wink.

Rhonda put a hand to her chest. "Maybe I should listen to *Doug* more often." With that, she winked back at him.

***

The next morning, Bill lifted himself from the bed, careful to dodge the creaking floorboard where his slippers waited. Without a sound, he hovered out of the bedroom and down the hall toward the flickering light of a dim halogen bulb above the sink in the kitchen. Stretching, Bill inhaled the smells of the home he and Rhonda lived in since he came back from the war. It wasn't exactly a pleasant scent, more dry-rotted wood and old potpourri gathering dust beneath the window unit they never got around to replacing. The stale air brightened with the smell of fresh coffee and cinnamon, an addition Bill grew to like despite protesting any time Rhonda tried to sneak it into drinks and dishes whenever possible after she read that it could be good for his heart.

Bill sipped the coffee then knelt down to inspect the damaged table leg.

"Sandpaper, some varnish, and maybe thirty minutes...give or take forty-something years," he whispered to himself.

Taking advantage of there being no one around to see him and his fortuitous positioning, Bill bowed his head.

"You know, if you're there, would you heal my wife? Even if it means Doug is right, and I know you know Rhonda would never let me live it down. I don't give a damn about this table. Hell, I don't give a damn about this house or being right or anything. I'd trade it all for her to be able to walk without pain. Oh, and I'm sorry to cuss, but I'm sure you've heard worse."

Not being the praying sort, Bill didn't know a good salutation, so he cleared his throat and nodded before pulling himself to his feet, then shuffled out to the patio where he donned his boots and a flannel before heading to his truck. The door of his 1987 Dodge Ram groaned in protest as he opened it and the dome light, which hadn't worked since his oldest daughter graduated, fizzled then glowed orange to match the rising sun.

"Well, I'll be damned," Bill said as he tapped the light.

He shut the door as quietly as he could manage then headed down the gravel driveway and drove on toward town all the while searching the shoulders for a lone crutch. When he was still a few miles from town, a faint light off in the woods caught his attention. The amber glow couldn't have been any bigger than the period at the end of this sentence, but it burned when Bill looked at it directly. No matter how many trees blocked it or even when he'd passed the old dairy and was certain he wouldn't be able to see it anymore, the light penetrated as though it were in front of it all. Bill slowed to pull off his glasses in an attempt to wipe the fleck from them, but the light persisted, albeit a bit blurry. Glancing down at his hand, he watched as the light began to trace the outline of his body, each part warming at first where it touched him.

"Mmm," he hummed.

It felt like being in a hot tub until it didn't. As the light finished the loop around him, awareness engulfed him. Something was wrong. To say it was numb would be an overstatement. He couldn't feel a thing. Even more important, he couldn't make himself reach for the brakes or move the steering wheel. He grunted, or tried to, but all that escaped were the last puffs of air from his lungs scented with the faint aroma of cinnamon.

His heavy foot jammed the accelerator to the floor, sending the truck racing down the dark road and onto the warning stripes of the shoulder for nearly a mile before a missing a slight bend and careening off the road into some nearby trees. On impact, Bill's truck spun two and a half turns, and, as his lights caught the dusted aluminum finish of a single crutch, Bill relaxed into his fate. He wouldn't be returning home; he couldn't have done anything about it anyway -- his hands had disappeared as the truck burst into flames.

Five miles away, Rhonda rolled over to throw her arms around Bill as she did each day before she'd sneak out of bed to pray in the living room, and cool, damp metal touched her skin. She moved her hand up to where Bill's rough face should be and squeezed the foam padding of the crutch sending drops of dew down her hand and onto the pillow. She felt for the tape Bill had wrapped around the cracking pad and found none.

"Bill?" she called out in the darkness. "You could have waited. Thank you!"

She reached for her glasses and clicked on the lamp at her side. The pull cord rocked with a *knock knock* she stopped with her hand, but the sound continued. Rhonda held her breath to listen. The knocking paused long enough for Rhonda to throw on her robe and grab her crutches, then it resumed, much louder this time. Rhonda's breathing shallowed. She crept down the hallway toward the sound when the doorbell rang.

"Bill? Did you lock yourself out again?" Rhonda's voice shook.

The muffled voice on the other side of the door was hard to recognize, but it wasn't Bill's.

"Mrs. Stellar? Are you in there? It's *hrmph hrmph hrmph*...," the voice repeated as it rang the doorbell again and again.

The porch light switch sizzled when she threw it on.

"Spaghetti sauce!" Rhonda swore to herself. Her jugular throbbed in her neck like it always did when she avoided the threat of damnation by careless indiscretion. She'd been convinced that, while God weighs the heart, any attempt at lexical purity was laudable. The thought of Hell plagued her mind, now more than ever. She stared at the doorknob.

The man outside waited for the door to open or a reply from the other side. When a minute passed, he pounded his gloved fist on it again and rang the doorbell.

"Mrs. Stellar? I know you're in there. It's Sheriff Gillingha...it's me. It's Mike. Can you open the door?" He reached for the knob and turned it.

Rhonda gripped the knob, made sure it was locked, and lowered herself to the ground where she sat, back to the door, and sobbed. When a tear fell down her nose and onto her lip, she sniffed it back in and the smell of coffee and freshly ground cinnamon filled her nose.

"He can't have been gone for more than ten minutes," she assured herself, then got on all fours and back onto her feet.

Brushing out the wrinkles in her nightgown, Rhonda wiped her eyes and opened the door to Mike's back. He spun around to Rhonda tripping on the step and braced himself on the railing which creaked in protest.

"Mrs. Stellar..." he started, but Rhonda interrupted.

"Where is he?"

Fiddling with his radio, Mike's eyes met hers. "Mrs. Stellar, there's been an accident. One of my deputies saw it happen. Bill lost control of his vehicle and spun into a line of trees."

"Oh Sweet Lord!"

"Now, I don't want you to get the wrong impression. There isn't a scratch on the truck, nothing more than a pinhole in the windshield..."

At that, Rhonda grabbed up the fabric of her nightgown about her neck and breathed into it.

"Mrs. Stellar, would you like to sit down?" Mike gestured toward the table in the kitchen behind her.

Panting, Rhonda nodded. Between breaths, she said with a smirk, "So...what seems...to be the...problem?"

Mike forced a smile and chortled. "I'd really prefer that you sit for this."

Rhonda's grin melted down her face. "If you insist. Come in."

She turned to walk up the stairs and over to the coffee pot.

"There's still a smidge of coffee if you want some." Feeling the pot, Rhonda offered, "I can heat it up in the microwave if you want, but it's hot." She swirled it around in the carafe and gave it a sniff. "He went light on the cinnamon this time. That man. One of these days he's gonna get it right."

"I've been nursing a cup all night. Any more and I'll be headed to the ER. Thank you, though."

"Suit yourself," Rhonda poured the remainder into a mug for herself and walked over to the table.

"You're getting around a good bit better on that foot than the last time I was here. Feeling back to normal?"

"I'm still hobbling around on these blasted..." Rhonda stopped halfway through pulling out a chair and glanced at the crutches she'd left at the porch door then down at her feet.

An electrical storm shot up her spine and down her arms to her fingertips. "I...well I'll be. Praise the Lord!"

Mike stood with his arms outstretched in the middle of the kitchen watching the seventy-something mother of his first girlfriend test out her ankle like it were a her first pair of roller skates. She did figure eights with her arms raised then jogged into the living room and back. When she hopped on it, Mike raced to her side to catch her.

"Mrs. Stellar, you be careful now. The last thing we need is you hurting yourself again," he admonished then pulled out a chair for her. "I'm happy you're feeling better, but we really need to talk."

Rhonda took the chair Mike offered and sucked her teeth. In her excitement, she'd forgotten all about why Mike was here. "Oh dear me. I must look like David dancing in his undergarments."

Mike scrunched up his nose at that and cleared his throat. "We can't find Bill. There's not so much as a drop of blood at the scene. No one walks away from that sort of accident without a scratch. I wouldn't believe it if one of my guys hadn't been there to see it."

"He picked up that crutch right there for me. Must have gone back out after. Did you check the store? That man never trusts anyone to open."

Mike set his hat on the table. "Ma'am, we've searched the scene.  Right now, they're looking at this as a missing person case, but there's something suspect about it. A man doesn't disappear without a trace. Bill wouldn't have a reason to...well...to..."

Rhonda grabbed his wrist. "Don't speak that into existence. He's going to turn up and have a good story to tell about it. Did you check his shop? He's probably kicked back watching the news in the back right now."
