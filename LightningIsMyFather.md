It was the worst birthday I'd ever had, the year I turned nine. They didn't have treats or songs or even friends. I don't even think they wished me "Happy Birthday".

"Lisk," my mother called out to me from her corner of the tent that afternoon before supper. "Lisk, come."

I approached her, but when I saw the tears in her eyes, my head shot almost completely around my neck for fear the villagers were behind me with a burlap sack and a belt to tie up into. I had learned about rites of passage in school one of the few times my parents let me attend. My heart raced and I let out a childish squeak I still regret.

She clapped my ear. "Be quiet, boy! Now sit."

I obeyed.

"Listen carefully and tell no one." She lowered her voice and continued. "The lightning is your father." Her eyes darted from my eyes to my mouth and back. "Say it, boy! The lightning is your father." [Change due to other book with similar words]

I couldn't speak. I searched on the little table beside her cot for an empty cup or a stinking pipe. Nothing. She grabbed me then. Pulled me into her face where I could smell the sweetness on her breath. The same sweetness she'd always had. She shook me. Shook me hard enough that my teeth clacked. Hard enough that my own breath popped out my throat in little bursts of voice. When I pulled away, when I tried to free myself from her crazy stare, she dug her fingernails hard into my forearm.

"Did you hear me? Say it!" Tears filled her gray eyes and spilled onto the broken skin of my arm.

*Sssss*, I winced. "You're hurting me!" My tears mixed with hers and turned pink as they dripped down my elbow and onto my boxers.

She stopped looking at me. Let me go. Looked down at the skin under her fingernails. Sobbed.

"Fetch me a cloth, boy" is all she said. Then she wrapped me up so tight I couldn't make a fist.

I've only heard my parents argue once. And it was on my ninth birthday. They made me leave the tent. Stand outside in the darkness where the mosquitoes would have eaten me, but didn't. Didn't because the storm was coming. The thunder overpowered my parents' muffled voices, but the one thing broke free from the walls of the tent.

"Nara," my father said, "death shall swallow you!" Then he cried.

My arms are hairier now. Stronger, too. But I can still see the claw marks my mother left me. I put my hands on them, fingernail to fingernail imprint, and say it again and again. It doesn't mean anything to me.

My father, my real father, looks just like me. Except for the scars on my arm, we could almost be twins now that my voice has dropped and my shoulders have thickened. Except for the wild streak of white hair he has now that he's older.

My mother passes me, stares at me, hollow like her mind has gone some days. It's my seventeenth birthday. Nine years have passed since my last present. Eight years since--the words fail me--since that day on the cot. Eight years since my father looked into my eyes. Eight years since I expected my mother to die. I thought my father would kill her that night. Instead, he's been sweeter to her than ever like he might lose her some day. Like she's his prized cabbage and the worms are coming. He's lost sleep hovering over her, watching, waiting.

I pitch some hay to the horses behind our tent. "The lightning is my father," I say as I shove the pitchfork deep into the stack. "What the hell does it mean?"

My father stumbles over toward me, head spinning from whatever he's got in that old clay cup. "You talking to yourself again, boy?" He throws an arm around my shoulder for support.

"No, Papa, not talking to myself." The lie tickles my belly as it leaves my lips. "Just humming, I guess."

Wine in the cup my father holds sloshes onto his hand. It stinks. Almost like vinegar. He raises the cup to his mouth and misses. A trickle traces his neck and falls into the hair on his chest. He looks down at it, shrugs, then tries to find my eyes. His own are slow to focus.

"Can you keep a secret, boy?" he asks slow and sloppy.

I don't want to. He's going to make me. I inhale then harden my face so he can't read me.

"Yes," I say.

"Here." He holds out the cup to me. When I don't take it, he shoves it into my free hand. "Drink. You're seventeen now."

I look into the cup. A few drops hug the inside. "It's empty," I say.

"There's enough." His voice sounds harsher, emotionless even.

I raise the cup to my lips, close my eyes, and wait for the drops to hit my tongue. They never do, but a fist crashes into my stomach. My father's fist.

I suck in all the air my diaphragm allows, but it isn't enough. My knees buckle and I double over.

"Idiot boy!" he shouts and slaps the back of my head. "You failed!" He snatches the cup I'm still clutching. "Never drink! It steals your dignity."

"But--" I start to protest.

"But nothing. Have you ever seen me drunk?"

Today? I think to myself. He must see it on my face.

"Oh, you think I'm drunk, do you?" He grabs me by the ear, the one that rings from all the times he's grabbed it before, and walks me into his shed.

I spot the tape-covered handle of an old knife on his workbench. It's stained almost purple. Nearby, three of what look like rat tails lie motionless. I look for the rest of the rats.

My father grabs a pitcher and pours. Chopped up bits of red and purple float to the top. He stops them with a finger. When the cup is full, he hands it to me.

"Drink it."

I clutch my stomach. "Papa, no. You said not to drink."

"I said not to drink alcohol. Drink it."

He pushes the bottom of the cup up toward my teeth fast enough that I have to close my lips to protect them.

"Papa," I say, but he forces the cup past my lips to shut me up.

"Drink, you stubborn boy."

The bitter juice slips past my mouth and throat. I gulp down two swigs to satisfy him, but he's still pouring, ignoring my squirming for a breath. My nose and lungs start to burn. I hack into the cup and knock it out of his hands. It shatters on the workbench he built himself when he was my age. He doesn't say anything for a while. When he does, his eyes are glassed over.

In a voice as quiet as a breeze, he says, "Your mother gave that cup to me on our second anniversary."

If it was so important, I think, then why be so careless with it. I say, "I'm sorry, Papa." I don't mean it.

He picks up the largest piece and places it in his palm, sharp edges down. With his other hand, he cups the curved exterior and presses his hands together.

"You know what the Japanese say about broken pots?" he asks.

I shrug. That I know the Japanese live in Japan is a miracle. What they say or how they sound when they say it is a mystery.

"Don't matter anyway. The world is a big, scary place, Lisk. You're gonna have to learn that one way or another." He sets down the shard, careful not to break it. His eyes scan my face for signs of something, then he smiles. "It's working, isn't it?" His voice reverberates.

I start to talk, but my tongue is thick. A tingle starts in my cheeks and melts down my neck, around to my shoulder blades, and up the back of my head. It's hard to focus. The letters on his old metallic gas can blur and float around the shed. I bob my head in affirmation.

"Not bad, is it?" I hear him ask. I might have been nodding. I don't know. My eyes were closed.

I hear the sound of sloshing, like slop in a bucket for the pigs, then feel the sting of ice-cold water and frozen chunks on my head chasing away the altered state I'd found myself enjoying.

"What the--" I bark.

"Watch that mouth, boy!" my father warns.

"Why did you do that?" I ask, patting my face with the only dry corner of my shirt.

"One of the most important things you'll ever know is something they don't teach you in those books. The mind is all-too-willing to take the slightest hint and make a whole thing out of it."

"Like magic?"

"Play-see-bow, they call it. Perception is reality. Don't you go thinking you're immune to it. None of us are."

I peek into the pitcher. The bits of reds, now separated from their juice, look like raspberry seeds. I'm not sure what the purple mash is.

My father pulls out a recipe. "Anti-Oxidant Booster" was scribbled at the top in my father's near-illegible writing. I scan it and spot the apple cider vinegar I must have tasted--and smelled--that made me think I had something I didn't. 

I lower my head. "That doesn't seem like much of a secret."

He grips my shoulder and squeezes. "That's not the secret." He sucks in a chestful of air and exhales, slow and loud. I feel the warmth of it on my wrist.

I should have known he had something to tell me. As stern as my father is in everything else, he has always skirted any serious discussions. Those he left to my mother unless he had no other choice. When my mother miscarried my only sibling, an unnamed boy they would later call Yari, my father took me out to a field and made me kill and field dress a dove before he told me. I swallowed hard and turned to look at him.

His Adam's apple bounced before he spoke. "Your mother's mind is gone, son."

"I know," my stomach flipped. "I've known since I was nine."

My fingertips find the holes in my arm, something I've done every day since. He notices and says what I've only thought.

"The lightning is not your father. It doesn't mean anything."

I glance up into his cold face, a reflection of my own with extra lines. "She told me never to tell anyone."

"She thinks it's some kind of salvation prayer. Thought it for years. Only time we ever fought, as far as I can remember, was about that damn phrase."

"Did you punch me and pretend to get me drunk to tell me that?" I ask, mash my eyes shut, and wait for the ringing to start again.

He stands above me for a second or two but shuffles off to the other side of the shed, kicking up a dust cloud as he goes.

My father was born "Carter James Jacobs", the first of three sons. First to leave home for love, first to change his name, and first to father a child. My uncles followed behind him as soon as they could. I've never met the family they ran from. I've only seen my uncles twice.
