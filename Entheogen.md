"Nothing in nature is pure, and purity is perfection." --Anderose Benson, "On the Nature of Nature and Order", 2017

You will have heard of rivers and rain and of families ripped apart by The Authority for possessing even a single drop. If you haven't, you weren't listening. The whys are vague, but each canister they sell you reminds you of "Progress through purity for your protection". Something's in the water, or it used to be. Removed for safety. Or subjugation. Or maybe for their own satisfaction. Any school kid with a second grade education from an underfunded school has heard some version of the story. Maybe it's a myth they started so we envy them more, to put us in our place--disillusioned and subservient--aware of how little we can do to escape them. Control the water, control the mind. Or so they say.

I pass you, nod, and you nod back--awkward and anxious--but correct. We walk no closer than necessary, twenty feet apart, until the street reaches a roundabout. The monument of Benson towers above and we stand at its base.

"And so we have removed the fangs of that serpent Nature," you say from memory.

"That we may be free and prosperous," I reply.

You fiddle with the keys in your pocket. I can tell you're nervous. Of course you would be. "First time?" I ask.

You don't respond. Only hold out a golden token. I palm it and kiss your awkward open mouth, passing the vial from mine to yours. If they only knew, our insides would paint this plaque before our eyes opened. Someone has told you what to do. You purse your lips, swallow hard, and keep kissing. The charade, to be believed, must look real. We pass several minutes locked together in a tangle of limbs, fix our clothes, and part. You'll head home to wait for digestion or a laxative to provide your purchase like they all do. I have another client.

I don't know where they come from. It's safer that way. Sex work is the cover, the vials are the product, or what's in them. I don't even know if they're real water, but the clients always return. You'll be back, too.

I've never had a drop of the stuff, and I'd like to keep it that way. It pays enough for my school and food. Nothing extravagant, and never enough to call attention to myself. Raids last week rounded up my best friend and a few of her clients. She got sloppy, bought herself a new car in the morning and spent the rest of the day in jail. She may still be there. Checking on her would incriminate me -- guilt by proximity.

I walk into my flat, toss the keys on my nightstand, and take off the tight leather skirt I wear to work. My last vial falls from a pouch sown into its waistband, rolls under my bed, and stops at a shoe box of memories collecting dust. I reach for it, tracing the crack in the base where it smacked the tile careful to not cut myself, and a single drop spills down my finger.

"Shit," I whisper then wipe my hand on my shirt.

Two weeks of profit for a fuck-up, and I watch the drop evaporate. I draw a circle around it and feel my ribs beneath. I have to cut calories or buy more of that cheap shit they market as meat in the cans. I don't know which is worse.

I clean myself of you, take a purgative, and climb into bed to fall asleep to the news.

"Intel obtained through an unnamed source led to the capture of another cell of Nature Now supporters hiding in an abandoned warehouse three miles from the city," the newscaster announced. "Most disheartening were the children living in makeshift rooms in the basement. Based on their reaction to our news crew, it would appear that none of them had ever been exposed to modern technology."

I scan the faces to see if any look like me, but they all have blonde or red hair. They're out there somewhere. A knock at the door interrupts a single tear that begins to form. I wipe it away and my face flushes hot.

"I'm in the bathroom! One second," I yell while I scan the room for any evidence, dart toward the bathroom to flush the broken vial, and walk back to the peephole to inspect. I grab some pajama bottoms draped over the couch arm by the door and pull them on.

Fear stops the words in my throat, but I wrestle them free. "What do you want?" I ask, then I lower my voice. "What the fuck are you doing here?"

*Open the door*, I tell my frozen hands. They comply, but not without hesitation.

You stand there dumbfounded, staring at me, mouth agape. I check the hall and pull you into my apartment.

"Look, I don't know how you found my place, but this shit isn't cool." When you don't respond, I add, "If you're a cop, go ahead and arrest me."

In the light, you look different than I expected. Not like the others. Like a puppy. You don't look older than maybe nineteen, twenty. Hell, you may not even be legal. You blink hard, reach inside your pocket. When your hand emerges, you have another gold coin. 

"Kid," I say, pushing the coin back toward you, "I'm all out. I think you look like you've had enough anyway. You can't come..."

"No," you interrupt and shake your head at the floor. "Y-You dropped this. I wanted to make sure you got it."

I pat my pants out of habit then take the coin. "This doesn't change anything. You could get us both arrested."

"Sorry, I just...I needed to make it right." You bite your lip. "I didn't follow you for long. I almost didn't, but when I spotted you near the quarter...I mean, I didn't try to find you or anything. It felt like fate or something and I didn't want to fuck it up. Besides," you say, brushing the hair our of your eyes, "you look like you need it more than me."

I hug my waist. "I'm fine," I say and feel a fire welling in my chest. "If you don't forget where I live, I'll find you next time. You hear me? Don't ever come here again." I reach for the door behind you and open it. "I hope your mom gets better," I announce to any eavesdropper.

You take my cue and step out into the hallway. "Thanks, I'll keep you posted," you say. "See you around, then."

"Yeah, around," I say.

Your smell lingers in my apartment, a mix of lavender and sweat and mint, a smell I'd never notice out there beneath the statues. My senses always go dull during the transactions, I almost forget they're humans on the other end instead of greedy leaches sucking from my mouth. I breathe you in, your innocence, your vulnerability, take you into my lungs and hold for a second, then let you out to rejoin yourself. Why'd you have to come here?

I wake the next morning later than I hoped, glance at myself in the small mirror above my toilet, brush the sleep from my eyes. My last shit looked better. I cover it with a quick layer of makeup, toss on a hoodie, and grab three stale crackers from a half-opened box by my sink. My stomach won't thank me for eating them, but it won't hate me, either. I'll have to buy more after class.

Stepping outside, a gust of cold wind catches my skirt and races up my legs like one of you grabbing for my warmth. I force it down and lean against the wind. Clouds have blocked the sun for the last three years. I don't know if I mind. A protest of Sun and Moon and the billions of stars, a refusal to bless what they're doing. I wonder how many worlds are full of nature denying itself, confident I know the answer.

I make it to my class and pull the door slow enough that it doesn't make a sound. The professor notices anyway. That smug, tight lip condemns me all the way to my seat near the back of the room.

"As I was saying, some of the worst offenders are those who need our help the most. It's not just the families, even Nature Now leaders would benefit from what social work has to offer. Coupled with psychotherapy, we can disabuse them of the very philosophies Benson sought to eradicate from the face of the Earth," they drone on with a mix of propaganda and truth. Better outcomes that way.

Blank faces nod approval like brainwashed idiots. I don't remember the mouth breathers from my childhood, from before the water changed. No pictures survived the purge--not officially.  Someone raises a hand, receives permission to speak, and aims a finger at me.

"You didn't recite the oath," they say.

I stand, place the thumb and forefinger of my left hand on my chin, and say, "Purity through purification," and take my seat. They haven't figured out how to read minds. If they do, I'm dead.

No one came to watch me walk or hear my name. No one saw me cry alone in my apartment. Those who care are gone, and I don't even know if they would be proud.
