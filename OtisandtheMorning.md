I awoke like always, in an unfamiliar room, face to face with a cat I recognized from my dreams, the left side of whose face aglow the crystal blue of glaciers. The medicine must be wearing off, I thought, and closed my eyes again. The world beneath the surface of my eyes reanimated, but this time I knew the difference.

Muted voices from out in the hallway drifted into my dreamlike consciousness, taking shape as butterflies feasting upon a corpse.
"They broke through," one said, face full of flesh, and then a gasp.
"How can we be sure?" another asked.
A pause as long as time, then someone said, "The cat."

"I am Morning," I heard the cat declare. "They cannot get to you. Not as long as you allow me to linger here."

"Yes," I said in a foreign voice I knew to be my own. When was the last time I spoke, I wondered. At that, I opened my eyes again, saw the black and white fur at the edge of my bed closest to the door and knew that Morning still watched over me. I relaxed back into the final waves of bliss as the ocean of my dreams met the dawn's shore. Through the dark of my eye lids, I watched Morning's glowing face transform into a hideous amalgamation of fangs and hair. "You are Midnight," I declared, struggling to recall the name of my protector.

"Otis? Wake up. Otis."

My body shakes or is shaken or both.

"Where's Midnight...I mean Morning? Where'd she go?" I ask before I realize where I am -- back in my own bed, posters and sketches on the wall, my mother's hand on my face.

"You went to bed so early last night. I started to worry you were getting sick," she says with a wrist to my forehead. "You don't feel warm."

I glance at my clock. 9:45. I've never slept this late. Images from the night dance like ghosts into the distance; I reach for them but come away with only the memory of Morning.

"I had the strangest dream," I say to my mother, and fail to recount it.

"Want some breakfast? The eggs are cold by now, but I can reheat them."

Food is the last thing I want, but I say, "Uh, sure. Thanks!" with a smile and she leaves. I lean down to peer under my bed, brushing aside the box of comics that has the empty cellophane with traces of the evening still in it.

"Morning?" I whisper as blood fills my head. "Where are you, girl?" The pounding of my heart in my brain intensifies and I right myself.

My mother calls me from the kitchen, "Food's ready!"

I half-fall out of bed, toss on some bottoms and slippers, and shuffle down the hallway into the bright kitchen squinting. "Mind if I close these?" I ask, gesturing to the dining room curtains, and close them without waiting for a response. The grotesque image Morning's face flashes with each blink, yet I feel comforted by it as though she made herself that way to ward off something lurking beyond my perception. Each time I take a journey, she greets me, then oversees like a sitter.
