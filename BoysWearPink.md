Mr. Jenkins came to school in a pink shirt. As he walked down the hall to his room, boys and girls laughed.

Mr. Jenkins didn't mind. He just smiled, said good morning, and kept on walking.

When he peeked into Mrs. Staugler's class, John P. and Donovan B. shouted, "Boys can't wear pink!" at the same time. Jacob J. said, "I like your shirt," in the quietest voice. No one heard him.

Mr. Jenkins smiled, said good morning, and kept on walking.

When he peeked into Mr. Smith's class, Sarah M. shouted, "You can't wear pink!" Makayla D. joined in. "Yeah, only girls can wear pink, Mr. Jenkins." Abel H. stood up, poked a finger in his chest, and said, "*My* dad has a shirt like that."

Mr. Jenkins smiled, said good morning, and kept on walking.

At lunch, Donald S. stopped Mr. Jenkins. "Why are you wearing *that* color?"

Mr. Jenkins bent down and whispered, "Can I tell you a secret?"

"Mhm," Donald said.

"Pink is one of my favorite colors."

Donald froze. A smile smeared over his face. "Can I tell you a secret?"

Mr. Jenkins nodded and knelt down.

"Pink is one of *my* favorite colors," Donald said to his feet. "But I'm too afraid to wear it to school." His face turned light pink.

"Some people say it's a girl color, but I think they're wrong. It's a *people* color. I like it, so I wear it. If you like it, you should wear it."

Two boys who had been listening giggled behind Donald and Mr. Jenkins. Mr. Jenkins looked sad.

"See what I mean?" Donald asked.

"Ya know, Donald," Mr. Jenkins talked louder, "I think it takes a brave kid to wear pink if they like it. Tomorrow is free-dress day. What if we both wore pink?"

Donald shrugged. "Maybe."

"No matter what, I'll wear pink tomorrow. Sound good?" Mr. Jenkins held out a hand.

Donald scratched his head to think. Finally, he shook Mr. Jenkins' hand with a smile. "Deal!"

The next day, after Donald put on his pants and an undershirt, he rummaged through his drawer for the perfect pink shirt. He had eleven.

Some had buttons, some had letters, some had pictures, and some all three. He didn't know which shirt to pick. He laid them on his bed to get a good look. Deciding was hard. The donuts doing somersaults in his belly didn't make it any easier.

He took a deep breath and closed his eyes. "No matter what," he told himself, "I'll wear pink tomorrow." Mr. Jenkins' words gave him courage. He took another breath and moved his hands over the shirts.

"I pick..." he let his hand fall, "...you!" Donald smiled when he opened his eyes to see what he picked.

On the bus, Abby T. popped her head over the seat and told him, "Boys can't wear pink."

Donald smiled. "Well, I put it on and I didn't explode, so I guess boys can."

She didn't know what to say, so she turned around.

At Jimmy T.'s stop, Donald saw that he had the same old monster shirt he always loved to wear. When he passed Donald's seat, Jimmy leaned in close. "Nice shirt," he said. He actually sounded like he meant it.

Donald grinned. "Thanks! I like your shirt, too." It wasn't a lie.

At school, Mr. Jenkins stood by the bus lane. Donald could see that his gray jacket was zipped almost all the way up to his neck. "Liar," Donald said and sunk back into his seat with a *THUNK*. His heart went *Blunk blum, Blunk blum* in his ears.

"Are you getting off the bus?" Sahara D. asked. Donald didn't say anything for a long time. A warm tear fell down his cheek.

"Is everything alright?" a familiar voice asked.

Donald looked up to see Mr. Jenkins and yelled, "You said, 'No matter what, I'll wear pink tomorrow,' and you didn't!"

Mr. Jenkins frowned. "Did I wear the wrong shirt? *ZIP* Hmm...looks pink to me."

Donald wiped his eyes. "It *is* pink!" he shouted, and, without even noticing, was halfway down the bus steps before he stopped himself. "Uhm..." he turned back to Mr. Jenkins, "will you walk with me to my class?"

"Absolutely!" Mr. Jenkins got off the bus and Donald followed, both proud in their pink shirts.

Jimmy, who had been waiting patiently by the bus, hugged his back pack and followed close behind them like a shadow. Mr. Jenkins felt a tug on his arm and looked to see that it was Jimmy.

"I don't like pink," Jimmy whispered.

Mr. Jenkins smiled. "You don't have to like pink, Jimmy."

Jimmy looked around to be sure no one could hear him. "I like...flowers...a lot."

Mr. Jenkins whispered something into Jimmy's ear, smiled, and the three of them walked down the hall.
