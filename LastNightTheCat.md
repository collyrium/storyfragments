Last night the cat flicked a chewed-up bit of centipede into my mouth. I didn't notice--I was sleeping.

In my dream, I had been fighting pirates who wore pajamas and used bread sticks instead of swords. They were winning.

"Eat the Crunch Medallion! Eat the Crunch Medallion!" my parrot squawked.

I reached into my coat pocket and felt the cool, smooth exterior of something I hadn't remembered I had until then. I took it out to inspect it--dark shell glistening in the sunlight.

"Don't let 'em eat it, boys!" the captain warned from behind me. "Thar's more power in that medallion than in all of Appalachia."

The closest pirate, a short man wearing a clown nose and a painted smile, rushed toward me with a banana aimed at my hand. I dodged him, spinning backward into the mast, and waved the Crunch Medallion for everyone to see.

Tiny words were printed on the underside of the medallion. "The ingestor of this medallion will experience a burst of strength and a sensation of metamorphosis characterized by..." I couldn't read fast enough to finish. I tossed it into my mouth and bit down. The flavor was somewhere between gross and unbearable that left an awful aftertaste with just a hint of bug legs. For something known as the Crunch Medallion, it lacked the crispiness I expected. It should be called the Gush Medallion.

When the juices hit my stomach, my arms popped into action, flashing in front of my face in a blur. Pirates and their bread swords flew out of my way. I turned to face the captain.

He took one look at me and ran toward the plank yelling "Abandon ship!".

"Abandon ship. Abandon ship," my parrot repeated.

The crew took one look at me and followed their captain overboard shouting such things as "She's hideous!", "Look at those jaws!", and "She'll eat us all!" before they jumped.

"Hideous, hideous," my parrot repeated.

Triumphant, I raced to the wheel to steer us back toward home, but when I reached up to grab the handles, my hands were gone, replaced with two rows of thin, black insect legs. I started to scream only a hiss came out as my mouth filled with the taste of a burp that brings up more than just a puff of stinky air.

"We heard you yelling. Your dad thought you fell out the bed again," my step-mom says at the breakfast table the next morning.

"I woke up with a pair of pinchers in my mouth. They tasted awful!" I tell them. The memory ruins my appetite. Besides, my tongue is still raw from all the brushing I gave it last night. I push my plate away and put my head down.

"I'll wrap your breakfast and put it in the fridge for when you're ready to eat," Mrs. Stacy says.

I nod. "Thank you," I say before putting my head back on the table. Her Saturday eggs and grits are my favorite. Would it be too long to wait until tomorrow before I eat?

"Dad, can we make Fritz sleep outside tonight?"

He chuckles and folds the newspaper. "So, first time eating a bug? I remember my first bug. It was a millipede in a sucker from the aquarium. The sucker itself tasted so nasty that I actually enjoyed the taste of the bug."

"I read that bugs are the superfood of the future," my step-mom says with a silly grin.

"Alive, dehydrated, or roasted?" my dad asks.

"Ew! Can we talk about something else? This is going to make me throw up."

My dad tosses up his hands in surrender but not without adding, "Hey, I think raw chicken would taste gross, but barbecue?" He smacks his lips before continuing, "Barbecued bugs may taste amazing. We'll never know if we don't give it a shot."

Mrs. Stacy pats my back. "Don't worry," she whispers, "I won't let him sneak any into your burger tonight."

I imagine hundreds of legs sticking out of a patty. Maybe I *will* wait until tomorrow to eat. I ask, "May I be excused?", but don't wait for a response.

I'm halfway to my room before I hear my dad answer, "Sure, sweetie." He's in another world when he's reading.

In my room, I search for remnants of centipede. Pieces I may have spat out, fragments on the wall or in the carpet. What I find sends shivers up my back--and bile up my throat. Fritz has a cockroach in her mouth. In my room. On my pillow!

"Fritz! Bad cat! Out! Shoo!" I swat her off my bed.

She drops the roach and scurries out my door. My stomach churns when I see that the roach is still half-alive and flapping on my pillow.

"Daddy!" I yell. I only say "Daddy" when it's something serious. He races down the hall and into my room with a rolled-up newspaper over his shoulder like a club.

"What is it, sweetie?" he asks then gasps for breath.

I point over to the roach. "Fritz can't come in my room ever again! She's trying to poison me!"

"She's not..." he heaves, "trying to poison you." He takes in a deep breath again and finally sounds normal. "Maybe she read the same article Mrs. Stacy did. Maybe she thinks you're one of her kittens, and she's..."

I interrupt. "I don't care what she thinks I am. She's not allowed back in my room!"

Fritz peeks around my dad's leg and gives me a long blink. I give her my best hiss. She ignores me and hops back onto my bed purring louder than ever. She buries her head in my chest begging me to pet her. How could I resist? 

My dad has an idea. "I tell you what, sweetie. Tonight, I'll lock the cat door so she can't bring in any more bugs," he says. "Ya know, we're lucky Fritz didn't find something bigger, something furrier to share."
